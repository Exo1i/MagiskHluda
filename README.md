**ðŸŒŸ This Magisk module is based on [Florida](https://github.com/Ylarod/Florida), a modified version of [Frida](https://github.com/frida/frida/) designed to be more undetectable.**

**ðŸŒŸ It ensures that Florida automatically starts on boot for you.**

## **New Web UI for Easier Control**  

Iâ€™ve added a **web-based user interface** that allows for easier control of the Florida server. The Web UI includes:

- A **start/stop server** button.
- Access to the **command usage documentation**.
- A display for **server status** and input for additional parameters.

This Web UI simplifies the management of the Florida server. It allows you to start/stop the server and also provide extra parameters without needing a terminal.

## **System UI Crashes Warning**

Please note that **stopping the Florida server may cause the System UI to crash**, which can result in a restart of the System UI. This issue is known, and it may cause temporary instability in the UI. Take care when stopping the server, and make sure to save any important work before doing so.
